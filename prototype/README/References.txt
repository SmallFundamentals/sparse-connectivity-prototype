These are some of the stuff that I skimmed when I started researching this last term. 
I myself need to read over most of these again, since it's been so long, but they're pretty useful and decently easy to read.
If we're committing to this solution (for now at least), I hope by the end each of us has at least a good enough high-level understanding of how it works and be able to explain it decently to somebody else.
You don't have to read these immediately, but they're here so you don't have to do the searching yourself.

Feel free to add stuff as you see fit.
